		<p>“Over the years, I have learned that true beauty comes from loving
and expressing ourselves as we are, and not from struggling towards perfection.
Confidence is where true beauty starts.</p>

		<p>After 12 years of intensive research in the cosmetic
industry in Germany, I was inspired to create an inclusive makeup line that
remedies fundamental inadequacies for women who look like me; this is why I
decided, through Janettotty, to make quality products available that would suit
similar skin tones and be easily accessible across Europe and Africa.</p>

		<p>I deeply believe that every colored woman should be able
to find the right makeup that matches her skin tone and projects her personal
style, without having to compromise, sacrifice quality, lose time mixing and
matching, or break the bank.</p>

		<p>Kenyan beauty is designed to accentuate your
natural beauty, not conceal it; and I am committed to helping every colored
woman feel confident and beautiful. I will forever stand by those values no
matter what.“With Kenyan beauty, there are no more excuses preventing you from radiating; it is time to find your perfect match!</p>
